## Dokuwiki Pagenav plugin

This is a fork of the [pagenav plugin][pagenav] with the following enhancements:
 * a top link to parent namespace start page when on the start page
 * unreadable and hidden (by $conf['hidepages']) pages are not linked

This was developped for the [Sacra Doctrina Library][sd].
